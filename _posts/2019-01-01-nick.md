## Intro

Welcome, thanks for taking the time to read my User Manual. I first started
recording some of this in 2012 and it has grown since then. You should consider
everything listed here as a *mild* preference and not as a strict demands. Feel
free to do what works for you best, but if you have no strong preferences you
can see how I like to operate below.

I'm always open for feedback [here](https://nickwolf.com.au/feedback) either
about my operation listed below or my behaviour in general.

### Communication

#### Medium

Nick prefers to have immediately important communication send through a fast
medium such as a direct message or call, and anything that does not require
immediate action sent through a slower medium via email.

A good guide is if you need it in the next few hours, message, if you need it
in the next few days, email and if you need it in the next few seconds, call.

| Timeframe      | Method        |
| ---------------|--------------:|
| Few days       |          Email|
| Few hours      | Direct message|
|***Right now!***|     Phone call|


#### Style

Nick prefers action based requests

_"Can you...? , I need...? , Will you...?"_

#### Timing

Nick generally prefers social or not work related messages either after 16:00 on
the week day or on the weekend so that he can do his best to focus on what he's
working on right now.

#### Scheduling Communication

Nick prefers that you either book him through his
[booking link](https://nickwolf.com.au/bookme) or by providing a list of options
rather than an individual time to prevent repeated scheduling attempts.

_"Does Monday 10:00, Tues 11:00  or Fri 12:30 suit?"_

He also greatly appreciates direct calendar invites, either through Google
Calendar or Facebook invites.

### Physical Contact

#### Handshakes

Nick prefers fist bumps to handshakes.

#### Hugging

Nick is very pro hug, and always happy to hug friends and even strangers, but
if you would like one you will have to verbally request one.

### Scheduling

#### Events

Nick is very calendar orientated, a nice way to get bonus points is if you send
though a calendar invite (either Google Calendar or Facebook Event)

#### One on One
Nick is available to book for social catchups (online or in person) at his
[website](https://nickwolf.com.au/bookme)

### Celebrations

#### Birthdays

Nick's favourite present for his birthday is feedback. He generally doesn't like
birthday cards.


### Food

#### Preferences

| Dislikes       | Notes                                       |
| ---------------| --------------------------------------------|
| Tomatoes       |  Don't like the texture, soup or sauce fine |
| Beetroot       |                       Don't like the flavour|
| Chocolate Cake |                   Don't like plain chocolate|

### Language

#### Improvement

Nick would like help reducing the amount he says _like_ superfluously.

Nick would also appreciate be called out on filler words such as _umm, err, etc_
